# Background: 
This is a database management class projects. I designed a hospital database managment system with ER diagram and schema diagram.

# What this system can do :
• The Hospital Management System (HMS) is for automation data managment in a hospital. The system takes care of all the requirements of an average hospital and is capable to provide easy and effective storage of information related to patients that come up to the hospital.
• It generates test reports; provide prescription details including various tests, check-up and medicines prescribed to patient and doctor. It also provides injection details and billing facility.
• The system also provides the facility of backup as per the requirement.

# Software 
SQLite

# Pipeline for building the system 
• Design the ER diagram

• Decide the Cardinality Relationships 

• Generate fake data for all the tables ( patient, patient_symtom , doctor, receptionist , nurse, bill ,accountant ,staff ) 

• Based on the ER diagram , Cardinality Relationships, complete the hospital_schema.sql( assign primary key , foreign key, composite key,data types etc. ) 

• Finish the hospital_load_csv_data.sql file to load csv files to the database 

• Read in tables into database and run different test cases to make sure the system is working properly
